# Flag System Implementation - Summary

## Issue Addressed
Created a content flagging system for the `/tall-tales` feature to allow users to report inappropriate content and provide admins with a moderation dashboard.

## Implementation Complete ✅

### Files Modified
1. `lib/tall-tales/types.ts` - Added ContentFlag and FlagReason types, extended StoredTallTale with soft delete fields
2. `lib/tall-tales/db.ts` - Added flag operations and soft delete functionality
3. `app/api/tall-tales/[id]/flag/route.ts` - New endpoint for users to flag content
4. `app/api/admin/flags/route.ts` - New endpoints for admins to view and manage flags
5. `app/tall-tales/page.tsx` - Added flag button and modal to tale UI
6. `app/settings/page.tsx` - Added admin dashboard card for flag management

### Files Created
1. `FLAG_SYSTEM_FEATURE.md` - Complete documentation of the flag system
2. Updated `TALL_TALES_FEATURE.md` - Added references to flag system

## Features Implemented

### User Features
✅ Flag button on each tale
✅ Modal to select flag reason (off-topic, inappropriate, spam, other)
✅ Optional comment field for additional context
✅ Success/error feedback messages

### Admin Features
✅ Admin dashboard card in Settings page
✅ List of all unresolved flags
✅ Flag details including:
  - Tale title and content preview
  - Flag reason
  - Reporter name
  - Optional comments
✅ Resolution actions:
  - Allow (marks flag as resolved)
  - Delete (soft-deletes content and resolves flag)

### Technical Features
✅ Soft delete system (no data loss)
✅ Authentication required
✅ Admin authorization checks
✅ Input validation
✅ Audit trail (who deleted what and when)
✅ Filters deleted content from queries

## Database Schema

### New Collection: contentFlags
```typescript
{
  id: string;
  taleId: string;
  flaggedBy: string;
  flagReason: "offtopic" | "inappropriate" | "spam" | "other";
  flagComment?: string;
  flaggedAt: Date;
  resolvedAt?: Date;
  resolvedBy?: string;
  resolution?: "allowed" | "deleted";
}
```

### Updated Collection: tallTales
```typescript
{
  // ... existing fields
  isDeleted?: boolean;
  deletedAt?: Date;
  deletedBy?: string;
}
```

## API Endpoints

1. `POST /api/tall-tales/[id]/flag` - Flag content (authenticated users)
2. `GET /api/admin/flags` - List unresolved flags (admin only)
3. `POST /api/admin/flags` - Resolve flag (admin only)

## Testing

✅ Build passes successfully
✅ No ESLint errors
✅ Code review completed with no issues
✅ UI mockups created and validated

## Screenshots

1. **Tall Tales Page** - Shows the main page layout
2. **Flag Button & Modal** - Demonstrates the flagging UI
3. **Admin Dashboard** - Shows the flag management interface

## Security Considerations

✅ All endpoints require authentication
✅ Admin endpoints check isAdmin status
✅ Input validation on flag reasons
✅ Soft deletes prevent data loss
✅ Audit trail for accountability

## Future Enhancements (Not Implemented)

- Email notifications for admins
- User notifications for deleted content
- Appeal system
- Flag history tracking
- Duplicate flag detection
- Auto-hide after threshold
- User suspension system

## Requirements Met

✅ Users can flag content for off-topic, inappropriate, or other reasons
✅ Users can add comments to flags
✅ Admin dashboard card to view flags
✅ Admin can allow or delete content
✅ Delete is a soft delete (content hidden but preserved in database)

## Status: COMPLETE AND READY FOR REVIEW
