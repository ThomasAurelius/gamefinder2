# Host Profile Link Feature

## Summary
Made the host name clickable in game cards and game detail pages, linking to a dedicated user profile page that shows the host's information.

## Problem Solved
Previously, users could see who was hosting a game session, but could not click on the host name to view more information about them. This made it difficult to learn more about the host before joining a game.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Created New User Profile Page
**File:** `app/user/[userId]/page.tsx`

A new profile page accessible at `/user/[userId]` that displays:
- User's avatar (or initial if no avatar)
- Display name (common name or username)
- Location
- Bio
- Favorite games
- Availability schedule
- Primary role

This page fetches data from MongoDB using existing functions:
- `getUserBasicInfo(userId)` - Gets user's basic info (name, avatar, email)
- `readProfile(userId)` - Gets user's profile details (bio, games, availability, etc.)

### 2. Updated Find Games Page
**File:** `app/find/page.tsx`

**Before:**
```tsx
<span className="text-slate-300">{session.hostName}</span>
```

**After:**
```tsx
<Link
  href={`/user/${session.userId}`}
  className="text-slate-300 hover:text-sky-300 transition-colors"
>
  {session.hostName}
</Link>
```

The host name is now:
- Clickable (links to `/user/[userId]`)
- Has a hover effect (changes to sky-300 color)
- Has a smooth transition

### 3. Updated Game Detail Page
**File:** `app/games/[id]/page.tsx`

**Before:**
```tsx
<div className="flex items-center gap-4">
  {/* avatar and name */}
  <p className="text-base text-slate-100">
    {host ? host.name : "Unknown Host"}
  </p>
</div>
```

**After:**
```tsx
<Link
  href={`/user/${session.userId}`}
  className="flex items-center gap-4 hover:opacity-80 transition-opacity"
>
  {/* avatar and name */}
  <p className="text-base text-slate-100">
    {host ? host.name : "Unknown Host"}
  </p>
</Link>
```

The entire Game Master section (avatar + name) is now:
- Clickable (links to `/user/[userId]`)
- Has a hover effect (opacity reduces to 80%)
- Has a smooth transition

## User Experience

### Before
- Users see "Host: John Smith" in game cards
- Host name is plain text, not interactive
- No way to learn more about the host without asking

### After
- Users see "Host: John Smith" in game cards
- Host name is a clickable link with hover effect
- Clicking the host name opens their profile page
- Profile page shows bio, favorite games, availability, and more
- Users can make informed decisions about joining games

## Technical Details

### No Database Changes Required
- Used existing `userId` field in game sessions
- Used existing `getUserBasicInfo` and `readProfile` functions
- No API changes needed
- No schema migrations required

### Consistent with Existing Code
- Uses same Link component from Next.js
- Follows existing styling patterns (slate colors, hover effects)
- Uses same MongoDB queries as other profile features
- Consistent with how other user information is displayed

### Benefits
1. **Minimal Changes:** Only 3 files changed, 114 lines added (mostly new profile page)
2. **No Breaking Changes:** All existing functionality preserved
3. **Reuses Existing Code:** Leverages existing user and profile functions
4. **Consistent UX:** Hover effects and transitions match existing patterns
5. **Improves Discoverability:** Users can now explore host profiles easily

## Testing
- ✅ Build successful (`npm run build`)
- ✅ Lint passed (`npm run lint`) - no new errors or warnings
- ✅ TypeScript compilation successful
- ✅ All routes properly configured

## Files Modified
1. `app/user/[userId]/page.tsx` - **NEW** - User profile page
2. `app/find/page.tsx` - Made host name clickable
3. `app/games/[id]/page.tsx` - Made Game Master section clickable
