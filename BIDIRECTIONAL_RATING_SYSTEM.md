# Bidirectional Rating System Implementation

## Overview
This feature extends the existing host rating system to include player ratings, creating a complete bidirectional rating system where hosts can rate players and players can rate hosts. A dedicated "Games History" page has been added to the settings section for easy access to past sessions and rating functionality.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Player Feedback System

Similar to the host feedback system, players can now be rated by hosts using the same yes/no/skip rating system.

#### Database Schema
Created a new collection `playerFeedback` with the following structure:

**Fields:**
- `id` (string): Unique identifier for the feedback
- `hostId` (string): User ID of the host who gave the feedback
- `playerId` (string): User ID of the player being rated
- `sessionId` (string): Game or campaign session ID
- `sessionType` ("game" | "campaign"): Type of session
- `recommend` ("yes" | "no" | "skip"): Rating choice
- `comment` (string, optional): Private comment visible only to player and admins
- `createdAt` (string): Timestamp of when feedback was submitted

**Stats Calculation:**
- `score`: yesCount - noCount (displayed as a number with + or - prefix)
- Total ratings count
- Individual counts for yes, no, and skip responses

### 2. API Endpoints

#### POST `/api/player-feedback`
- **Purpose**: Submit or update feedback for a player
- **Authentication**: Required (user must be logged in via cookies)
- **Request Body**: 
  ```json
  {
    "playerId": "string",
    "sessionId": "string",
    "sessionType": "game" | "campaign",
    "recommend": "yes" | "no" | "skip",
    "comment": "string (optional)"
  }
  ```
- **Response**: Returns the created/updated feedback object
- **Validation**: Prevents hosts from rating themselves

#### GET `/api/player-feedback/stats/[playerId]`
- **Purpose**: Get feedback statistics for a specific player
- **Authentication**: Optional (affects whether comments are included)
- **Response**: 
  - Public view: Basic stats (score, counts)
  - Player/Admin view: Stats + all feedback comments
- **Access Control**: Comments only visible to the player being rated or admins

### 3. UI Components

#### PlayerFeedbackDialog
A modal dialog that allows hosts to rate players:
- Three choice buttons: Yes (üëç), No (üëé), Skip (‚è≠Ô∏è)
- Optional comment textarea with privacy notice
- Visual feedback on selection
- Submit and cancel buttons
- Error handling and loading states

**Features:**
- Updates existing ratings if host has already rated the player for that session
- Clear privacy messaging: "Only the player and admins can see your comments"
- Responsive design matching the app's dark theme

#### PlayerRatingDisplay
Displays player rating on public profiles:
- Shows game controller emoji (üéÆ) with score number
- Color-coded score (green for positive, red for negative, gray for neutral)
- Optional detailed view showing breakdown of yes/no/skip counts
- "No player ratings yet" message for players without ratings
- Loading state while fetching data

#### PlayerFeedbackSection
Comprehensive feedback view for players on their dashboard:
- Large game controller display with total score
- Breakdown of total ratings and counts
- Expandable comments section (toggle button)
- Individual feedback cards showing:
  - Rating emoji
  - Date of feedback
  - Comment text
- Privacy reminder at bottom

### 4. Games History Page

A dedicated page at `/settings/games-history` that shows all past game sessions and campaigns.

**Features:**
- Shows all past sessions (games and campaigns) sorted by date
- For players: Shows "Rate Host" button on sessions they participated in
- For hosts: Shows "Rate Players" button with expandable list of all players in the session
- Clicking "Rate Players" loads player information and displays inline rating buttons
- Reuses existing game session card component for consistency
- Integrates with both HostFeedbackDialog and PlayerFeedbackDialog

**Navigation:**
- Accessible from Settings page via "View Games History" link
- Listed in the settings menu alongside Profile Settings and Subscriptions

### 5. Integration Points

#### Settings Page (`/settings`)
- Added "Games History" card with link to `/settings/games-history`
- Positioned between Profile Settings and Subscriptions for easy access

#### User Profile Page (`/user/[userId]`)
- Added PlayerRatingDisplay component below HostRatingDisplay
- Shows both host and player ratings on public profiles
- Labels clearly distinguish between "Host Rating" and "Player Rating"
- Includes detailed breakdown for both rating types

#### Player Dashboard (`/dashboard`)
- Added rating sections showing both host and player feedback stats
- Displays HostFeedbackSection and PlayerFeedbackSection side by side
- Users can view their ratings from both perspectives

#### Host Dashboard (`/host/dashboard`)
- Added PlayerFeedbackSection after HostFeedbackSection
- Hosts can see their ratings as both host and player

#### Games History Page (`/settings/games-history`)
- Dedicated page for viewing and rating past sessions

### 6. User Experience Flow

**For Hosts Rating Players:**
1. Complete a game session or campaign as a host
2. Navigate to Settings ‚Üí Games History
3. Find the completed session
4. Click "Rate Players" button
5. System loads player information for that session
6. Click "Rate" next to each player
7. Select Yes/No/Skip and optionally add comment
8. Submit feedback

**For Players Rating Hosts:**
1. Complete a game session or campaign as a player
2. Navigate to Settings ‚Üí Games History (or Dashboard)
3. Find the completed session
4. Click "Rate Host" button
5. Select Yes/No/Skip and optionally add comment
6. Submit feedback
7. Button updates to "Update Host Rating"

**Viewing Your Ratings:**
1. Navigate to Dashboard to see rating summary
2. Click to expand feedback comments (if any)
3. View detailed breakdown of ratings
4. See individual comments from hosts/players

**Viewing Others' Ratings:**
1. Visit any user's profile at `/user/[userId]`
2. See both host rating (‚≠ê) and player rating (üéÆ)
3. See breakdown of ratings
4. Comments remain private

### 7. Privacy & Security

**Privacy Features:**
- Comments only visible to:
  - The person being rated (host or player)
  - System administrators
- Clear messaging to users about comment privacy
- Public scores visible to everyone
- Individual ratings remain anonymous (rater ID not shown in UI)

**Security Measures:**
- Authentication required to submit feedback (via cookies)
- Validation prevents self-rating (hosts can't rate themselves, players can't rate themselves)
- Users can only rate others they've played with (session-based validation)
- Database queries properly filter by user permissions
- Uses MongoDB driver properly to prevent injection vulnerabilities

### 8. Database Functions

**lib/player-feedback/db.ts:**
- `submitPlayerFeedback`: Create or update feedback for a player
- `getPlayerFeedbackStats`: Get public statistics
- `getPlayerFeedbackWithComments`: Get feedback with comments (admin/player only)
- `hasHostSubmittedFeedback`: Check if host already rated a player in a session
- `getMultiplePlayersStats`: Batch fetch stats for multiple players (for optimization)

### 9. Type Definitions

**lib/player-feedback/types.ts:**
- `PlayerFeedbackPayload`: Input data for submitting feedback
- `StoredPlayerFeedback`: Complete feedback record from database
- `PlayerFeedbackStats`: Aggregated statistics for a player

## Technical Details

### Rating Calculation
- **Score = Yes Count - No Count**
- Skip votes don't affect the score but are counted
- Example: 10 yes, 3 no, 2 skip = Score of +7
- Consistent with host rating calculation

### Performance Considerations
- Feedback stats cached on client side during page load
- Batch fetching capability for multiple players
- Lazy loading of player information (only when "Rate Players" is clicked)
- Comments only fetched when player/admin views them
- Games History page loads all sessions once, then filters locally

### Responsive Design
- Mobile-friendly dialogs and components
- Touch-friendly button sizes
- Readable text sizes across devices
- Dark theme consistent with app design
- Grid layout for rating sections on larger screens

### Code Reuse
- Mirrored host feedback system architecture for consistency
- Reused game session card component in Games History page
- Similar UI patterns for both host and player rating dialogs
- Consistent API patterns across all feedback endpoints

## Conclusion
