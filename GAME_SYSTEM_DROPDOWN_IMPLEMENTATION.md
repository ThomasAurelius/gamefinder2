# Game System Dropdown Implementation for Tall Tales

## Overview
Added a game system dropdown field to the Tall Tales feature with an "Other" option that conditionally displays a custom input field.

## Changes Made

### 1. Types (`lib/tall-tales/types.ts`)
- Added `gameSystem?: string` to `TallTalePayload` and `StoredTallTale`
- Added `customGameSystem?: string` to `TallTalePayload` and `StoredTallTale`

### 2. Validation (`lib/tall-tales/validation.ts`)
- Added validation logic for `gameSystem` field
- Added conditional validation for `customGameSystem` when "Other" is selected
- Both fields are optional and safely validated

### 3. Database Operations (`lib/tall-tales/db.ts`)
- Updated `listTallTales()` to return `gameSystem` and `customGameSystem` fields
- Updated `getTallTale()` to return `gameSystem` and `customGameSystem` fields
- Updated `createTallTale()` to store `gameSystem` and `customGameSystem` fields
- Updated `updateTallTale()` to handle `gameSystem` and `customGameSystem` fields

### 4. UI (`app/tall-tales/page.tsx`)
- Added state management for `gameSystem` and `customGameSystem`
- Added game system dropdown after title field
- Uses existing `GAME_OPTIONS` constant from `lib/constants.ts` (includes: Dungeons & Dragons, Pathfinder, Starfinder, Shadowdark, Other)
- Added conditional custom input field that shows when "Other" is selected
- Updated form submission to include game system fields
- Updated tale display to show game system (or custom game system name when "Other" is selected)
- Game system appears below the author name and date in the tale list

## Features
- **Optional field**: Users can leave it empty if they prefer not to specify
- **Dropdown selection**: Quick selection from popular game systems
- **Custom input**: When "Other" is selected, a text input appears for custom game system names
- **Visual consistency**: Follows the same styling pattern as other forms in the app (post/page.tsx, post-campaign/page.tsx)
- **Data persistence**: Game system information is stored in the database and displayed in the tales list

## User Experience
1. User navigates to Tall Tales page
2. Fills out title (required)
3. Optionally selects a game system from dropdown
4. If "Other" is selected, a custom input field appears
5. Continues with story content and images
6. Submits tale
7. Tale is displayed with game system information below author details

## Backward Compatibility
- Fields are optional, so existing tales without game system data will continue to work
- Validation only processes game system fields if they are provided
- Database operations handle missing fields gracefully
