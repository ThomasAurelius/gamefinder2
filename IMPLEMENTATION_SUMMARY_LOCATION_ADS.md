# Implementation Summary: Location-Based Advertisement Feature

## Issue
Update the Advertisement to also only show within 100 miles of the users zipcode. Use a zipcode field for the advertisement. Allow multiple advertisements to be going and default to the closer of the 2 if they overlap.

## Solution Implemented ✅

### 1. Database Changes
- Added `zipCode` (optional string) field to store advertisement's target location
- Added `latitude` and `longitude` (optional numbers) to store geocoded coordinates
- Modified to support multiple active advertisements simultaneously

### 2. Location-Based Filtering
- Created `getActiveAdvertisementForUser()` function that:
  - Filters advertisements within 100 miles of user's location
  - Returns the closest advertisement when multiple are in range
  - Falls back to global ads (no location) when user is out of range
  - Maintains backward compatibility for users without location

### 3. API Enhancements
- **GET /api/advertisements**: Automatically fetches user's profile location and filters ads
- **POST /api/advertisements**: Accepts optional `zipCode` parameter and geocodes it

### 4. Admin Interface
- Added "Zip Code (optional)" input field in Settings → Admin: Advertisement section
- Clear instructions: "Leave blank to show to all users. If provided, ad will only show within 100 miles"
- Description updated to reflect new location-based functionality

### 5. Geocoding Integration
- Leverages existing `geocodeLocation()` utility from `lib/geolocation.ts`
- Uses OpenStreetMap Nominatim API (free, no API key needed)
- Gracefully handles geocoding failures (ad becomes global if coordinates unavailable)

## Key Features

### ✅ 100-Mile Radius
- Maximum distance hardcoded as constant: `MAX_DISTANCE_MILES = 100`
- Uses Haversine formula for accurate distance calculation

### ✅ Multiple Advertisements
- System supports multiple active advertisements
- Each can have its own zip code or be global (no zip code)
- When multiple ads are within range, closest is shown
- When user is out of range of all located ads, global ads are shown

### ✅ Automatic Selection Priority
1. First priority: Closest advertisement within 100 miles
2. Second priority: Advertisements without location (global)
3. Fallback: No advertisement shown

### ✅ Backward Compatibility
- Users without location in profile see first active ad
- Existing advertisements without zip codes continue to work
- No breaking changes to existing functionality

## Testing Results

All 5 test scenarios passed:
1. ✅ User within 100 miles of ad → Correct ad selected
2. ✅ User near different ad → Correct regional ad selected
3. ✅ User far from all ads → Global ad shown
4. ✅ User without location → First active ad shown
5. ✅ Multiple ads in range → Closest ad prioritized

## Technical Implementation

### Distance Calculation
```typescript
// Haversine formula - calculates great-circle distance
// Earth radius: 3959 miles
const distance = calculateDistance(
  userLat, userLon,
  adLat, adLon
);
```

### Filtering Algorithm
```typescript
1. Get all active advertisements
2. If user has location:
   a. Filter ads with coordinates
   b. Calculate distance to each
   c. Keep only ads within 100 miles
   d. Sort by distance (closest first)
   e. Return closest ad
3. If no ads within range or no user location:
   a. Return first ad without location (global)
4. If no ads at all:
   a. Return null (no ad shown)
```

## Files Modified
- `lib/advertisements/types.ts` - Schema update
- `lib/advertisements/db.ts` - Core filtering logic
- `app/api/advertisements/route.ts` - API endpoint updates
- `app/settings/page.tsx` - Admin UI with zip code field
- `LOCATION_BASED_ADVERTISEMENTS.md` - Comprehensive documentation

## Usage Instructions

### For Administrators
1. Navigate to Settings page
2. Scroll to "Admin: Advertisement" section
3. Upload advertisement image (800x800 recommended)
4. **NEW**: Enter zip code in "Zip Code (optional)" field
   - Example: "78729" for Austin, TX
   - Leave blank for global advertisement
5. Check "Display advertisement" checkbox
6. Click "Save Advertisement"

### For Users
No changes required. The system automatically:
- Fetches user's location from their profile
- Filters advertisements based on distance
- Shows the most relevant ad

## Verification
- ✅ Build successful - no errors
- ✅ TypeScript compilation passes
- ✅ All test cases pass
- ✅ Code review completed - no issues found
- ✅ Backward compatibility maintained
- ✅ Documentation complete

## Impact
- **Admin Experience**: Simple one-field addition to create location-targeted ads
- **User Experience**: Seamless - advertisements automatically become more relevant
- **Performance**: Minimal impact - geocoding only on save, filtering at query time
- **Scalability**: Efficient with current approach, could add caching if needed

## Future Enhancements (Not Implemented)
- UI to manage multiple advertisements (list view)
- Analytics on advertisement performance by region
- Support for multiple zip codes per advertisement
- Custom radius per advertisement (currently fixed at 100 miles)
- Advertisement scheduling (start/end dates)
