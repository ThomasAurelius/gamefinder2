# Fix Summary: FeaturedVendorsFeed Distance Calculation

## Issue Description
The `FeaturedVendorsFeed` component was not calculating distances to vendors, causing `isNearbyVendors` to always be false. The issue stated that the data (zip codes) was available in the database to make the calculation.

## Root Cause
Vendors in the database had zip codes but lacked latitude/longitude coordinates. The `listVendorsByLocation` function requires vendors to have coordinate data to calculate distances using the Haversine formula. Without coordinates, vendors couldn't be matched to user locations, resulting in empty "nearby vendors" results.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Code Changes (`lib/vendors.ts`)
Added automatic geocoding of vendor zip codes:

- **Import**: Added `geocodeLocation` from `lib/geolocation.ts`
- **createVendor**: Now geocodes the zip code when creating a new vendor
- **updateVendor**: Now geocodes the zip code when updating a vendor

The geocoding:
- Uses OpenStreetMap's Nominatim API (free, no API key required)
- Handles errors gracefully (continues without coordinates if geocoding fails)
- Respects API rate limits
- Works for US zip codes with proper context

### 2. Migration Script (`scripts/geocode-vendors.ts`)
Created a TypeScript migration script to geocode existing vendors:

- Finds all vendors with zip codes but no coordinates
- Geocodes each vendor's location
- Updates vendor documents with latitude/longitude
- Respects the 1 req/sec API rate limit
- Provides detailed progress and summary output
- Handles errors gracefully without stopping the migration

### 3. Package Configuration (`package.json`)
- Added `tsx` as a dev dependency for running TypeScript scripts
- Added `migrate:geocode-vendors` npm script for easy execution

### 4. Documentation (`docs/VENDOR_GEOCODING_MIGRATION.md`)
Comprehensive documentation covering:
- Problem and solution overview
- How to run the migration
- Expected behavior going forward
- Technical details and error handling
- Testing procedures
- Rollback instructions

## Files Changed
- `lib/vendors.ts` - Added geocoding to create and update functions (29 lines added)
- `scripts/geocode-vendors.ts` - Migration script (104 lines added)
- `package.json` - Added migration script and tsx dependency
- `package-lock.json` - Dependency updates for tsx
- `docs/VENDOR_GEOCODING_MIGRATION.md` - Documentation (115 lines)

**Total: 771 lines added across 5 files**

## How It Works

### New Behavior for Vendors
1. **Creating vendors**: Zip code is automatically geocoded to latitude/longitude
2. **Updating vendors**: Zip code is re-geocoded if changed
3. **Querying nearby vendors**: Works correctly with coordinate data

### FeaturedVendorsFeed Behavior
1. Component requests vendors with `?nearMe=true`
2. API checks if user has location coordinates
3. `listVendorsByLocation` finds vendors within 50 miles
4. Vendors are sorted by distance (featured first, then by distance)
5. Display shows "Nearby Venues" with distance information
6. Falls back to "All Venues" if no nearby vendors found

## Validation

### Build & Lint
- ✅ ESLint passes (no new errors or warnings)
- ✅ TypeScript compilation successful
- ✅ Next.js build completes successfully

### Security
- ✅ CodeQL analysis passed with 0 alerts
- ✅ No security vulnerabilities introduced

## Next Steps for Deployment

1. **Deploy the code changes** to production
2. **Run the migration script**:
   ```bash
   npm run migrate:geocode-vendors
   ```
3. **Verify** that vendors now have coordinates
4. **Test** the FeaturedVendorsFeed component with a logged-in user
5. **Confirm** that "Nearby Venues" appears and shows distance

## Benefits

- ✅ Fixes the reported issue completely
- ✅ Minimal code changes (surgical fix)
- ✅ Reuses existing geocoding infrastructure
- ✅ Backward compatible (vendors without coordinates still work)
- ✅ Self-healing (all new/updated vendors get coordinates automatically)
- ✅ Well documented for future reference
- ✅ No security vulnerabilities
- ✅ No breaking changes

## Technical Notes

- The geocoding service uses OpenStreetMap's Nominatim API, which is free and doesn't require an API key
- Rate limiting is handled properly (1 request per second)
- Error handling ensures the system degrades gracefully if geocoding fails
- The same geocoding function is already used successfully by the advertisements system
