# Character Edit UI Layout Changes

## Overview
This document describes the UI layout changes made to the `/characters` page to improve the editing experience.

## Changes Made

### Previous Layout
- All character cards were displayed in a single "Saved Characters" section
- When editing, the form appeared below all character cards
- The character being edited remained in the list with all other characters

### New Layout
When editing a character:

1. **Current Values Section** (Top)
   - The character being edited is shown in a collapsible `<details>` element
   - Labeled as "Current Values" with emerald green highlighting
   - Displays all the current data for the character being edited
   - Starts collapsed by default to reduce clutter
   - Can be expanded to view current values while editing

2. **Edit Form Section** (Middle)
   - The edit form appears directly below the Current Values section
   - Contains all editable fields for the character
   - Same functionality as before, just repositioned

3. **Other Characters Section** (Bottom)
   - Displays all characters EXCEPT the one currently being edited
   - Title changes from "Saved Characters" to "Other Characters" when in edit mode
   - Allows easy access to edit other characters without scrolling past the form

### When Not Editing
- Shows standard "Saved Characters" section with all characters
- Form section is collapsed (can be expanded to add a new character)

## Technical Implementation

### Key State Variables
- `editingCharacterId`: Tracks which character is being edited
- `isFormOpen`: Controls whether the form is visible
- `isCurrentValuesOpen`: Controls whether the Current Values section is expanded

### Helper Function
- `renderCharacterDetails()`: Reusable function to render character details consistently

### Filtering Logic
- Current Values section: `characters.filter((item) => item.id === editingCharacterId)`
- Other Characters section: `characters.filter((item) => !editingCharacterId || !isFormOpen || item.id !== editingCharacterId)`

## Benefits

1. **Better Focus**: The character being edited is prominently displayed at the top
2. **Reduced Scrolling**: Edit form appears right after current values, not at the bottom
3. **Easy Comparison**: Can expand Current Values to compare with edited values
4. **Clear Separation**: Visual distinction between the character being edited and others
5. **Improved Workflow**: Can quickly switch to editing other characters without closing the form
