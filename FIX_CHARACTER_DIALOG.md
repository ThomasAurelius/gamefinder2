# Character Selection Dialog Fix

## Issue
When clicking "Request to Join" on a game session, the character selection dialog should appear to allow the user to select a character before joining. However, users reported that the dialog doesn't appear.

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue likely stemmed from a combination of factors:
1. **Low visual prominence**: The dialog's z-index of 50 and semi-transparent backdrop (60%) may have caused it to be missed or appear behind other elements
2. **No guard against multiple opens**: Rapid clicks could cause state confusion
3. **Button disable logic**: Only the specific session button was disabled, not all buttons during join operations

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced Dialog Visibility (`components/CharacterSelectionDialog.tsx`)

#### Visual Improvements:
- **Z-index**: Increased from `z-50` to `z-[9999]` to ensure dialog appears above all elements
- **Backdrop**: Made more opaque (`bg-black/80` vs `bg-black/60`) and increased blur (`backdrop-blur-md` vs `backdrop-blur-sm`)
- **Border**: Changed from subtle `border border-slate-800` to prominent `border-2 border-sky-500` with glow effect (`shadow-sky-500/20`)
- **Header**: Added subtle background tint (`bg-sky-900/20`) to distinguish sections

#### Behavior Improvements:
- Added `handleBackdropClick` function to properly handle clicking outside the dialog
- Added `stopPropagation` on dialog content to prevent closing when clicking inside
- Only closes when explicitly clicking the backdrop or Cancel button

```tsx
// Before
<div className="fixed inset-0 z-50 flex items-center justify-center bg-black/60 backdrop-blur-sm p-4">
  <div className="w-full max-w-md rounded-xl border border-slate-800 bg-slate-900 shadow-2xl">

// After  
<div 
  className="fixed inset-0 z-[9999] flex items-center justify-center bg-black/80 backdrop-blur-md p-4" 
  onClick={handleBackdropClick}
>
  <div className="w-full max-w-md rounded-xl border-2 border-sky-500 bg-slate-900 shadow-2xl shadow-sky-500/20" onClick={(e) => e.stopPropagation()}>
```

### 2. Improved Join Button Logic (`app/find/page.tsx`)

#### Button Disable Logic:
Changed from disabling only the specific session button to disabling ALL buttons during any join operation:

```tsx
// Before
disabled={joiningSessionId === session.id}

// After
disabled={joiningSessionId !== null}
```

This prevents users from clicking multiple join buttons simultaneously and ensures a cleaner user experience.

#### Guard Against Multiple Opens:
Added a check to prevent opening the dialog if it's already open:

```tsx
const handleJoinClick = (sessionId: string) => {
  if (showCharacterDialog) {
    return; // Prevent opening dialog if already open
  }
  setSessionToJoin(sessionId);
  setShowCharacterDialog(true);
};
```

## Files Modified
1. `app/find/page.tsx` - 5 lines changed
2. `components/CharacterSelectionDialog.tsx` - 16 lines changed

Total: 21 lines modified across 2 files

## Testing Recommendations
1. Click "Request to Join" button - dialog should appear prominently with sky-blue border
2. Click outside dialog (on backdrop) - dialog should close
3. Click inside dialog - dialog should remain open
4. Click "Request to Join" rapidly multiple times - should only open once
5. Try to click multiple "Request to Join" buttons - should only allow one operation at a time
6. Select a character and confirm - should join game with character
7. Click cancel - should close dialog without joining

## Expected Behavior After Fix
- Dialog appears immediately and prominently when clicking "Request to Join"
- Dialog is clearly visible with sky-blue border and dark backdrop
- Dialog cannot be opened multiple times simultaneously
- Only one join operation can be in progress at a time
- User can close dialog by clicking backdrop or Cancel button
- User can select a character or join without one
