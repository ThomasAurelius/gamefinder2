# Avatar Link Implementation Summary

## Overview
This PR implements clickable avatars in the navbar that navigate users to their profile page at `/profile`.

## Problem Statement
The avatars in the navbar (both mobile and desktop views) were previously just visual elements without any interaction. Users had to navigate through the Account dropdown menu to access their profile.

## Solution
Made both avatars clickable by wrapping them with Next.js Link components pointing to `/profile`.

## Changes Made

### 1. Mobile Avatar (Lines 168-183)
**Before:**
```tsx
<div className="md:hidden">
  {/* avatar content */}
</div>
```

**After:**
```tsx
<Link href="/profile" className="md:hidden">
  {/* avatar content */}
</Link>
```

### 2. Desktop Avatar (Lines 371-387)
**Before:**
```tsx
{userAvatarUrl ? (
  <img ... />
) : (
  <div className="h-8 w-8 text-xs">...</div>
)}
```

**After:**
```tsx
<Link href="/profile">
  {userAvatarUrl ? (
    <img ... />
  ) : (
    <div className="h-12 w-12 text-sm">...</div>
  )}
</Link>
```

### 3. Size Consistency Fix
Fixed the desktop avatar fallback div to use `h-12 w-12` and `text-sm` (previously `h-8 w-8` and `text-xs`) to match the avatar image size.

## Benefits
1. **Improved UX**: Users can quickly access their profile with a single click on their avatar
2. **Consistency**: Aligns with common web patterns where avatars are clickable
3. **Efficiency**: Provides a shortcut alternative to the Account dropdown menu
4. **Mobile-Friendly**: Works seamlessly on both mobile and desktop views

## Technical Details
- Uses Next.js `Link` component for client-side navigation
- Maintains existing responsive behavior (mobile vs desktop)
- Preserves all styling and visual appearance
- No breaking changes to existing functionality

## Testing Results
- ✅ TypeScript compilation successful
- ✅ Next.js build completed without errors
- ✅ ESLint passes with no new warnings
- ✅ Code review completed with no issues

## Files Modified
- `components/navbar.tsx` (21 lines changed: 18 additions, 15 deletions, 2 context lines modified)

## Implementation Notes
- The Link component was already imported in the file
- Both avatar implementations handle users with and without profile pictures
- The mobile avatar link maintains the `md:hidden` class for responsive behavior
- No additional dependencies or configuration required
