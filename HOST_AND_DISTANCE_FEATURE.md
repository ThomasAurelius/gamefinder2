# Host and Distance Display Feature

## Overview
This feature adds the display of the game host's name and calculated distance in the game session cards on the Find Games page, making it easier for users to identify who is hosting each game and how far away it is from their location.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated API Routes to Include Host Information

**Files Modified:**
- `app/api/games/route.ts`
- `app/api/games/my-games/route.ts`
- `app/api/games/[id]/join/route.ts`

**What Changed:**
- Added import for `getUsersBasicInfo` from `@/lib/users`
- After fetching game sessions, the API now fetches host information for all unique user IDs
- Each session object is enriched with `hostName` and `hostAvatarUrl` fields
- This ensures consistent host information across all API endpoints

**Code Example:**
```typescript
// Fetch host information for all sessions
const hostIds = [...new Set(sessions.map(s => s.userId))];
const hostsMap = await getUsersBasicInfo(hostIds);

// Add host information to sessions
const sessionsWithHosts = sessions.map(session => ({
  ...session,
  hostName: hostsMap.get(session.userId)?.name || "Unknown Host",
  hostAvatarUrl: hostsMap.get(session.userId)?.avatarUrl,
}));
```

### 2. Updated GameSession Type Definition

**File Modified:**
- `app/find/page.tsx`

**What Changed:**
- Added optional `hostName?: string` field
- Added optional `hostAvatarUrl?: string` field

This allows TypeScript to properly type-check the new fields throughout the component.

### 3. Updated GameSessionCard Component

**File Modified:**
- `app/find/page.tsx`

**What Changed:**
- Added a new "Host" field that displays before the Date field
- The host name is shown with a label "Host:" in slate-500 color
- The host name itself is displayed in slate-300 color for better readability
- Only displays if `hostName` is available

**Visual Change:**
```tsx
{session.hostName && (
  <p>
    <span className="text-slate-500">Host:</span>{" "}
    <span className="text-slate-300">{session.hostName}</span>
  </p>
)}
```

### 4. Distance Display (Already Implemented)

The distance calculation and display was already implemented in the codebase:
- Distance is calculated in the API route when a location search is provided
- Distance is displayed in the GameSessionCard as "(X.X mi away)" in sky-400 color
- This feature now works consistently with the host information

## Features

### Host Display
- **Label:** "Host:" appears before each game session's information
- **Styling:** Consistent with other metadata fields (Date, Times, Location, Players)
- **Fallback:** Shows "Unknown Host" if host information cannot be retrieved
- **Color scheme:** Uses slate-500 for labels and slate-300 for values

### Distance Display (Enhanced)
- **Calculation:** Server-side using the Haversine formula
- **Display:** Shows as "(X.X mi away)" next to the location
- **Color:** Sky-400 to match the app's accent color scheme
- **Conditional:** Only displays when distance data is available

## Example Card Layout

```
[Game Image]  Dungeons & Dragons                    [Join Game]

              Host: John Smith
              Date: January 15, 2025
              Times: 6:00 PM, 7:00 PM
              Location: Seattle, WA (12.5 mi away)
              Players: 3/4
              
              Join us for an epic adventure...
```

## Technical Details

### API Performance
- Uses bulk user lookup with `getUsersBasicInfo()` to minimize database queries
- Fetches all unique host IDs in a single query
- Maps results efficiently using JavaScript Map objects

### Type Safety
- All TypeScript types properly updated
- Optional fields handle cases where data might not be available
- Consistent type definitions across API and frontend

### Consistency
- All three API endpoints (GET /api/games, GET /api/games/my-games, POST /api/games/[id]/join) return consistent data structures
- This ensures host information is available whether browsing all games, viewing user games, or after joining a game

## Testing

- ✅ TypeScript compilation successful
- ✅ ESLint checks passed (no new errors)
- ✅ Build successful with Next.js
- ✅ Code changes minimal and focused

## Integration with Existing Features

This feature integrates seamlessly with:
1. **Location Search:** Distance is calculated when user searches by location
2. **User Profiles:** Host names link to the user management system
3. **Game Detail Page:** Consistent with how host information is displayed on detail pages
4. **Dashboard:** Host information also available in user's game dashboard

## Benefits

1. **User Experience:** Users can immediately see who is hosting each game
2. **Trust:** Knowing the host helps users decide which games to join
3. **Proximity:** Distance information helps users find nearby games
4. **Consistency:** Host display matches the pattern used in game detail pages
