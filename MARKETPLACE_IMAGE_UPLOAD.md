# Marketplace Image Upload Implementation

## Overview
This implementation adds direct image upload functionality to marketplace listings, replacing the previous external URL-only approach. Users can now upload images directly from their devices when creating or editing marketplace listings.

## Changes Made

### 1. Upload API Enhancement (`app/api/upload/route.ts`)
- Added support for "marketplace" as a valid image type
- Images are stored in Firebase Storage at path: `marketplace/{userId}/{filename}`
- Maintains consistency with existing upload types (avatar, game, character, tale, advertisement)

### 2. Create Marketplace Listing Page (`app/marketplace/post/page.tsx`)

#### Before:
- Multiple text input fields for external image URLs
- Manual URL entry required
- "Add Another Image" button to add more URL fields
- No image preview

#### After:
- Single file upload button
- Image preview grid showing uploaded images
- Delete button on each image thumbnail
- Maximum 5 images per listing
- Upload progress indicator
- Supported formats: JPG, PNG, WebP, GIF (max 5MB per image)

#### Key Features:
```typescript
const handleImageUpload = async (event: React.ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>) => {
  // Uploads file to /api/upload with type "marketplace"
  // Adds returned URL to imageUrls array
  // Shows upload progress and error handling
}
```

### 3. Edit Marketplace Listing Page (`app/marketplace/[id]/edit/page.tsx`)

#### Changes:
- Same file upload functionality as create page
- Preserves existing images when loading
- Allows adding new images up to the 5-image limit
- Can remove existing images before saving

## User Experience

### Creating a New Listing:
1. Fill out listing details (title, description, etc.)
2. Click "Upload Images" button
3. Select an image file from device
4. Image uploads and displays in preview grid
5. Can add up to 5 total images
6. Can remove any uploaded image before submission
7. Submit listing with uploaded images

### Editing an Existing Listing:
1. Existing images are loaded and displayed in preview grid
2. Can remove existing images
3. Can upload new images (up to 5 total)
4. Changes saved when form is submitted

## Technical Details

### Image Upload Flow:
1. User selects file via file input
2. JavaScript creates FormData with file and type "marketplace"
3. Sends POST request to `/api/upload`
4. Server validates file type, size, and user authentication
5. Uploads to Firebase Storage
6. Returns public URL
7. URL added to component state and displayed in preview
8. URLs submitted with form data to marketplace API

### Storage Structure:
```
Firebase Storage:
└── marketplace/
    └── {userId}/
        ├── {uuid1}.jpg
        ├── {uuid2}.png
        └── {uuid3}.webp
```

### Constraints:
- Maximum 5 images per listing
- Maximum 5MB per image
- Allowed formats: JPEG, PNG, WebP, GIF
- Authentication required

## Benefits

1. **Better User Experience**: No need to host images elsewhere
2. **Simplified Process**: Upload directly from device
3. **Immediate Preview**: See images before submitting
4. **Consistency**: Matches image upload patterns in other features
5. **Reliable Storage**: Images hosted on Firebase, not dependent on external links

## Compatibility

- Backward compatible: Existing listings with external URLs continue to work
- Forward compatible: New uploads use direct file upload
- No database migration needed: Still stores URLs in imageUrls field

## Testing

- ✅ Build successful with no errors
- ✅ TypeScript compilation successful
- ✅ Follows existing code patterns
- ✅ Error handling implemented
- ✅ Upload progress indicators in place
