## 🎉 Success Metrics

| Metric | Before | After | Status |
|--------|--------|-------|--------|
| Supported Systems | 2 (D&D, Starfinder) | 5 (All systems) | ✅ +150% |
| File Types | 1 (PDF) | 5 (PDF + 4 images) | ✅ +400% |
| Max Files/Character | 3 PDFs | 3 PDFs or Images | ✅ Same |
| Security Issues | 0 | 0 | ✅ Maintained |
| Build Status | Passing | Passing | ✅ Maintained |

## 📝 Notes for Developer

- The API route is named `upload-pdf` but now handles both PDFs and images
- The field name is `pdfUrls` but stores both PDF and image URLs
- Consider renaming these for clarity in future refactor (not critical)
- File storage in Firebase under `character-sheets/{userId}/` folder
- Files are UUID-named to prevent conflicts

- ✅ Support for Pathfinder
- ✅ Support for Shadowdark
