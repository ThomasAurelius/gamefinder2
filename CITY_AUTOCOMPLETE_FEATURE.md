# City Autocomplete Feature Implementation

## Overview
Replaced simple text inputs for location fields with an intelligent city autocomplete component that uses the OpenStreetMap Nominatim API to provide searchable city suggestions as users type.

## Changes Made

### New Files Created

1. **`/app/api/cities/route.ts`** - API endpoint for city search
   - Handles server-side calls to the Nominatim API
   - Filters results to only show cities, towns, and villages
   - Formats results with city, state/region, and country
   - Returns up to 10 suggestions per query
   - Removes duplicate results

2. **`/components/CityAutocomplete.tsx`** - Reusable autocomplete component
   - Provides dropdown suggestions as users type
   - Debounces API calls (300ms) to reduce server load
   - Supports keyboard navigation (Arrow Up/Down, Enter, Escape)
   - Shows loading indicator during API calls
   - Closes dropdown when clicking outside
   - Fully accessible with proper ARIA attributes

### Modified Files

1. **`/app/profile/page.tsx`**
   - Replaced location text input with CityAutocomplete component
   - Updated placeholder text to guide users

2. **`/app/players/page.tsx`**
   - Replaced location search input with CityAutocomplete component
   - Maintains compatibility with zip code searches

3. **`/app/post/page.tsx`**
   - Replaced location text input with CityAutocomplete component
   - Keeps optional behavior for location field

4. **`/app/find/page.tsx`**
   - Replaced location search input with CityAutocomplete component
   - Preserves radius selection functionality

## Features

### User Experience
- **Live Search**: Results appear as you type (minimum 2 characters)
- **Smart Formatting**: Results show as "City, State" for US locations and "City, State, Country" for international
- **Keyboard Support**: Navigate with arrow keys, select with Enter, close with Escape
- **Loading Feedback**: Spinner indicates when searching
- **Manual Entry**: Users can still type their own location if desired

### Technical Implementation
- **Debouncing**: Prevents excessive API calls while typing
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support with proper type definitions
- **Performance**: Efficient filtering and deduplication of results
- **Consistent Styling**: Matches existing input field styles across all pages

## API Details

### Endpoint: `/api/cities`
**Method**: GET  
**Query Parameters**:
- `q` (string, required): Search query (minimum 2 characters)

**Response Format**:
```json
[
  {
    "displayName": "Austin, Texas",
    "value": "Austin, Texas",
    "lat": 30.2672,
    "lon": -97.7431
  }
]
```

### External API Used
- **Service**: OpenStreetMap Nominatim API
- **Rate Limiting**: Built-in debouncing (300ms) reduces request frequency
- **User Agent**: "GameFinder2-App/1.0" (as required by Nominatim)

## Testing

### Build Status
✅ Build successful with no errors
✅ TypeScript compilation passes
✅ All existing functionality preserved

### Pages Updated
- ✅ Profile page - location field
- ✅ Players Search page - location search field
- ✅ Post a Game page - location field
- ✅ Find a Game page - location search field

## Benefits

1. **Better User Experience**: No need to remember exact city spelling or format
2. **Consistent Data**: Standardized location format improves geocoding accuracy
3. **Discoverability**: Users can explore cities by typing partial names
4. **International Support**: Works for cities worldwide, not just US locations
5. **Backwards Compatible**: Users can still manually enter zip codes or type custom locations

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future iterations:
- Cache popular city searches to reduce API calls
- Add current location detection using browser geolocation
- Display country flags or icons for better visual recognition
- Group results by country or region
- Add recent searches/favorites functionality
