### Verify Your Stripe Configuration

Before starting development, validate your Stripe setup:

```bash
npm run validate:stripe
```

This will check:
- ‚úÖ Environment variables are properly set
- ‚úÖ API keys have correct format (test vs live)
- ‚úÖ Both keys are in the same mode
- ‚úÖ Connection to Stripe API works

If you get errors about missing keys, see [STRIPE_SETUP.md](./STRIPE_SETUP.md) for setup instructions.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
