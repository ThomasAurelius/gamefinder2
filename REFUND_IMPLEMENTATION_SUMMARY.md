# Refund Feature Implementation Summary

## Overview

This implementation adds a complete refund system that allows game hosts (DMs) to issue refunds to players when they need to cancel a campaign or session. The feature includes API endpoints, a user interface component, and comprehensive documentation.

## Files Added

### 1. API Endpoints

#### `/app/api/stripe/refund/route.ts`
**Purpose:** Process refunds for both subscription and one-time payments

**Key Features:**
- Host authorization verification (only campaign hosts can issue refunds)
- Subscription handling:
  - Cancels subscription immediately (no waiting for period end)
  - Retrieves latest invoice
  - Issues refund for paid invoices
- One-time payment handling:
  - Searches for payment intents
  - Issues refunds for all successful charges
- Comprehensive error handling with detailed logging
- TypeScript type casting for Stripe API properties not in type definitions

**Security:**
- Authentication required (cookie-based)
- Authorization check (must be campaign host)
- Player verification (subscription/payment must belong to specified player)

#### `/app/api/stripe/campaign-payments/route.ts`
**Purpose:** Retrieve payment information for a campaign

**Key Features:**
- Lists all subscriptions and one-time payments for campaign players
- Can filter by specific player ID
- Converts Stripe amounts from cents to dollars
- Returns detailed payment status

**Security:**
- Authentication required
- Authorization check (must be campaign host)

### 2. UI Component

#### `/components/CampaignRefundManager.tsx`
**Purpose:** React component providing UI for hosts to manage refunds

**Key Features:**
- Automatically fetches payment information for all campaign players
- Uses batch API (`/api/users/batch`) for efficient user data loading
- Displays payment details:
  - Payment type (subscription vs one-time)
  - Amount and currency
  - Status
  - Cancellation status for subscriptions
- Refund functionality:
  - "Issue Refund" button for each payment
  - Processing state management
  - Success/error message display
  - Automatic refresh after refund
- Responsive design with Tailwind CSS

**Integration:**
```tsx
import CampaignRefundManager from "@/components/CampaignRefundManager";

// In your campaign management page:
{campaign.userId === currentUserId && (
  <CampaignRefundManager
    campaignId={campaign.id}
    playerIds={campaign.signedUpPlayers}
    onRefundIssued={() => {
      // Optional callback
    }}
  />
)}
```

### 3. Documentation

#### `/REFUND_FUNCTIONALITY.md`
Comprehensive documentation covering:
- API endpoint details with request/response formats
- Usage examples (both API and component)
- Security considerations
- Error handling
- Testing guidelines for Stripe test mode
- Future enhancement ideas

## Technical Implementation Details

### Stripe Integration

**Subscriptions:**
1. Retrieves subscription by ID
2. Verifies customer ownership
3. Cancels subscription immediately with prorating
4. Retrieves latest invoice
5. Issues refund for paid charges

**One-Time Payments:**
1. Lists payment intents for customer
2. Filters by campaign ID metadata
3. Issues refunds for all successful charges

**Type Safety:**
- TypeScript type casting for properties not in Stripe type definitions
- Proper error handling for API responses

### Database Integration

- Uses existing `getCampaign()` from `lib/campaigns/db.ts`
- Uses existing `getStripeCustomerId()` from `lib/users.ts`
- Uses existing `getUsersBasicInfo()` for batch user data retrieval

### Error Handling

**API Level:**
- 400: Invalid request (missing parameters)
- 401: Unauthorized (not authenticated)
- 403: Forbidden (not campaign host)
- 404: Not found (campaign, player, or payment)
- 500: Server error (Stripe API failures)
- Detailed error messages and logging

**UI Level:**
- Loading states
- Error message display
- Success confirmation
- Disabled states for processing/completed actions

## Security Measures

1. **Authentication:** All endpoints require user authentication via cookies
2. **Authorization:** Campaign host verification before processing any refund
3. **Ownership Verification:** Ensures subscriptions/payments belong to specified player
4. **Stripe Customer Validation:** Verifies player has a payment profile
5. **No Sensitive Data Exposure:** Returns only necessary payment information

## Testing Recommendations

### Manual Testing with Stripe Test Mode

1. **Setup:**
   - Use test API keys in `.env.local`
   - Test card: `4242 4242 4242 4242`

2. **Test Subscription Refund:**
   - Create a paid campaign with subscription
   - Have a test player join and pay
   - Use refund API or UI to cancel and refund
   - Verify in Stripe Dashboard:
     - Subscription is canceled
     - Refund is created with status "succeeded"

3. **Test One-Time Payment Refund:**
   - Create a paid campaign with one-time payment
   - Have a test player join and pay
   - Use refund API or UI to issue refund
   - Verify refund in Stripe Dashboard

4. **Test Authorization:**
   - Try to issue refund as non-host (should fail with 403)
   - Try to issue refund without authentication (should fail with 401)

### Automated Testing (Future Enhancement)

Consider adding:
- Unit tests for API endpoints
- Integration tests with Stripe test mode
- Component tests for UI behavior

## Compatibility

- **Next.js:** Compatible with App Router (async server components)
- **React:** Client component with hooks
- **Stripe API:** Version `2025-09-30.clover`
- **TypeScript:** Fully typed with proper type casting
- **Tailwind CSS:** Uses existing design system

## Performance Considerations

1. **Batch API Usage:** Component uses `/api/users/batch` to fetch all player data in one request
2. **Efficient Queries:** Stripe API calls are optimized to minimize requests
3. **Caching:** Consider implementing caching for payment data if needed

## Future Enhancements

1. **Partial Refunds:** Allow hosts to specify refund amount
2. **Refund History:** Track refunds in database for audit trail
3. **Automatic Refunds:** Trigger refunds when campaign is deleted
4. **Email Notifications:** Notify players when refunds are issued
5. **Bulk Refunds:** Refund all players with one action
6. **Refund Reason UI:** Add text field for custom refund reasons
7. **Refund Analytics:** Dashboard showing refund statistics for hosts

## Code Quality

- ✅ TypeScript compilation passes with no errors
- ✅ No security vulnerabilities found (CodeQL analysis)
- ✅ Follows existing code patterns and conventions
- ✅ Proper error handling and logging
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation
- ✅ Code review feedback addressed

## Deployment Checklist

- [ ] Ensure Stripe API keys are configured in production
- [ ] Test in Stripe test mode before deploying
- [ ] Switch to live Stripe keys for production
- [ ] Monitor error logs after deployment
- [ ] Test refund flow with real test transactions
- [ ] Verify Stripe webhooks (if configured) handle refunds correctly
- [ ] Update user-facing documentation/help pages
- [ ] Train support team on refund process

## Support and Maintenance

**Common Issues:**
1. **Refund Fails:** Check Stripe Dashboard for detailed error
2. **Player Not Found:** Verify player has a Stripe customer ID
3. **Authorization Error:** Ensure user is the campaign host
4. **Subscription Not Found:** Verify subscription ID is correct

**Monitoring:**
- Monitor Stripe Dashboard for failed refunds
- Check application logs for refund-related errors
- Track refund metrics (count, amounts, reasons)

**Stripe Dashboard:**
- All refunds appear in Stripe Dashboard > Payments
- Use metadata to filter by campaign or player
- Check refund status and reason
