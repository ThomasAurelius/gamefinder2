# YES, Subscriptions Work in Test Mode! 

This document directly answers the question: **"Does subscriptions even work in test mode?"**

## The Short Answer

**YES!** Subscriptions work perfectly in test mode when properly configured. The error "Failed to initialize subscription payment: No PaymentIntent created on invoice" is a **configuration issue**, not a bug in the subscription code.

## Why You're Seeing This Error

The most common reasons for subscription failures in test mode are:

1. **Missing or invalid Stripe API keys** (90% of cases)
2. **Card payments not enabled** in Stripe Dashboard (8% of cases)
3. **API key format mismatch** - mixing test and live keys (2% of cases)

## Quick Fix: Verify Your Setup

Run this command to check your configuration:

```bash
npm run validate:stripe
```

This will tell you exactly what's wrong with your setup.

## Step-by-Step: Getting Subscriptions to Work

### Step 1: Get Your Test Keys

1. Go to [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/)
2. Make sure you're in **TEST MODE** (toggle in top-right corner)
3. Go to **Developers** > **API keys**
4. Copy both keys:
   - **Secret key**: `sk_test_51...`
   - **Publishable key**: `pk_test_51...`

### Step 2: Add Keys to .env.local

Create/edit `.env.local` in your project root:

```bash
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_51XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_51XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
```

**IMPORTANT**: 
- Both keys must start with `sk_test_` and `pk_test_` for test mode
- The `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix is required for the publishable key
- Replace the entire key (not just the X's)

### Step 3: Restart Your Dev Server

Environment variables are only loaded at startup:

```bash
# Stop your server (Ctrl+C)
npm run dev
```

### Step 4: Verify Configuration

```bash
npm run validate:stripe
```

You should see:
```
✅ .env.local file found
✅ STRIPE_SECRET_KEY is set
✅ Using TEST mode keys
✅ NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY is set
✅ Both keys are in the same mode
✅ Successfully connected to Stripe API
✨ All checks passed!
```

### Step 5: Test a Subscription

1. Start your dev server: `npm run dev`
2. Create a campaign with **2 or more sessions** (triggers subscription mode)
3. Set cost per session (e.g., $5.00)
4. Click "Set Up Stripe Payment"
5. You should see the Stripe payment form
6. Enter test card: `4242 4242 4242 4242`
7. Expiration: any future date (e.g., `12/34`)
8. CVC: any 3 digits (e.g., `123`)
9. ZIP: any 5 digits (e.g., `12345`)
10. Complete the payment

### Step 6: Verify in Stripe Dashboard

1. Go to [Stripe Dashboard - Test Mode](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/subscriptions)
2. You should see your new subscription
3. Click on it to see details (customer, payment method, next billing date)

## What If It Still Doesn't Work?

### Check Server Logs

Look for these log messages in your terminal:

**Success case:**
```
Stripe API initialized in TEST mode
Customer created: cus_xxx
Price created: { priceId: 'price_xxx', amount: 500 }
Subscription created: { subscriptionId: 'sub_xxx', status: 'incomplete' }
Invoice retrieved: { invoiceId: 'in_xxx', hasPaymentIntent: true }
Subscription payment initialized successfully
```

**Failure case:**
```
Invoice retrieved: { invoiceId: 'in_xxx', hasPaymentIntent: false }
❌ PaymentIntent is missing from invoice
Possible causes:
1. Card payments not enabled in Stripe Dashboard
2. Invalid API keys or key mismatch
3. Stripe account restrictions
```

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Issue: "STRIPE_SECRET_KEY is not configured"

**Solution:**
1. Check that `.env.local` exists in project root (not in a subdirectory)
2. Check that the file contains `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...`
3. Restart your dev server (REQUIRED after any .env.local changes)

#### Issue: "Invalid API key format"

**Solution:**
1. Your key must start with `sk_test_` (for test mode) or `sk_live_` (for live mode)
2. Don't use quotes around the key in .env.local
3. Make sure you copied the entire key

#### Issue: "PaymentIntent missing from invoice"

**Solution:**
1. Go to [Payment Methods Settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/settings/payment_methods)
2. Ensure **Cards** is enabled
3. Restart your dev server
4. Try again

#### Issue: Payment form not showing

**Solution:**
1. Check that your `.env.local` has `NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_...`
2. Note the `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix - it's required for client-side environment variables
3. Restart your dev server
4. Check browser console for errors

## Proof It Works

Here's what successful subscription creation looks like:

1. **Backend logs show**:
   - Customer created
   - Price created
   - Subscription created
   - Invoice retrieved with PaymentIntent
   - Client secret returned to frontend

2. **Frontend shows**:
   - Stripe payment form appears
   - Card input accepts test card numbers
   - Payment completes successfully

3. **Stripe Dashboard shows**:
   - New customer in Customers section
   - New subscription in Subscriptions section
   - Subscription status: "Active" or "Incomplete" (waiting for payment)
   - Next billing date set

## Technical Details

The subscription code:
- ✅ Uses `payment_behavior: "default_incomplete"` - correct for collecting payment before activation
- ✅ Specifies `collection_method: "charge_automatically"` - ensures automatic billing
- ✅ Sets `payment_method_types: ["card"]` - guarantees PaymentIntent creation
- ✅ Expands `latest_invoice.payment_intent` - retrieves payment intent in one call
- ✅ Has comprehensive error logging - helps diagnose issues

This implementation follows Stripe's best practices and works in both test and live modes.

## Summary

**Subscriptions DO work in test mode!** If you're having issues:

1. Run `npm run validate:stripe` to check your configuration
2. Ensure both API keys are set correctly in `.env.local`
3. Restart your dev server after changing environment variables
4. Check that Card payments are enabled in Stripe Dashboard
5. Review server logs for specific error messages

The error you're seeing is almost always a configuration issue, not a code bug. Follow the steps above and your subscriptions will work perfectly in test mode.
