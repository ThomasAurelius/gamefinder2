# Implementation Notes: DM Dashboard Subscription Status

## Issue
The DM/host wanted to see which players have an active subscription in their campaign view.

## Solution
Added subscription status badges to the campaign detail page that show whether each player has an active subscription for paid campaigns.

## Files Changed

### 1. `app/api/stripe/check-players-subscriptions/route.ts` (NEW)
- POST endpoint that accepts campaignId and array of playerIds
- Returns a map of playerId -> boolean (subscription status)
- Queries Stripe for each player's active subscriptions
- Handles missing Stripe configuration gracefully
- Requires authentication

### 2. `app/campaigns/[id]/page.tsx` (MODIFIED)
**Type Addition:**
- Added `hasActiveSubscription?: boolean` to `PlayerWithInfo` type

**New useEffect Hook:**
- Fetches subscription status after players are loaded
- Only runs if:
  - Current user is the campaign creator
  - Campaign has a cost per session (is paid)
  - There are signed up players
- Updates player list with subscription status

**UI Changes:**
- Added badges next to each player in Current Players section
- Green "Active Sub" badge for players with subscriptions
- Gray "No Sub" badge for players without subscriptions
- Badges only show for paid campaigns
- Uses flex layout to position badges on the right

### 3. `SUBSCRIPTION_STATUS_DM_FEATURE.md` (NEW)
Complete feature documentation including:
- Overview and use cases
- Technical implementation details
- Security considerations
- Performance notes

## Key Design Decisions

1. **Batched API Call**: Single request checks all players instead of individual requests per player
2. **Conditional Loading**: Only fetches when needed (creator view + paid campaign)
3. **Graceful Degradation**: Doesn't break if Stripe is not configured
4. **Visual Clarity**: Clear color-coded badges with icons
5. **Minimal Changes**: Only modified necessary code, no breaking changes

## Testing Considerations

To test this feature:
1. Create a paid campaign (with costPerSession > 0)
2. Have players sign up
3. Some players create subscriptions via Stripe
4. View campaign as creator
5. Verify badges show correct subscription status

## Security

- Only authenticated users can call the API
- Only campaign creators see subscription status
- Uses existing Stripe customer ID infrastructure
- No sensitive payment data exposed

## Performance

- Single API call for all players (not N+1 queries)
- Client-side check after initial page load
- Cached in component state
- Minimal impact on page load time

## Future Enhancements

Possible future improvements:
- Add subscription status to waitlist players
- Show subscription renewal dates
- Add filters to show only subscribed/unsubscribed players
- Email notifications for subscription status changes
