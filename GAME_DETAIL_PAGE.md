# Game Detail Page Implementation

## Overview
This implementation adds a dedicated game detail page that displays comprehensive information about a game session, including all players signed up, waitlist, and game metadata.

## Changes Made

### 1. New API Route: `/api/games/[id]` (GET)
**File**: `app/api/games/[id]/route.ts`

- Fetches a single game session by ID
- Returns 404 if game session not found
- Returns full game session details including players and waitlist

### 2. New User Utilities Library
**File**: `lib/users.ts`

Created helper functions to fetch user information:
- `getUserBasicInfo(userId)` - Get basic info for a single user
- `getUsersBasicInfo(userIds[])` - Get basic info for multiple users efficiently
- Returns user ID, name, and email
- Handles fallback to email prefix if name is not set

### 3. Game Detail Page Component
**File**: `app/games/[id]/page.tsx`

A comprehensive server-side rendered page that displays:

#### Page Sections:
1. **Back Navigation** - Link to return to Find Games page
2. **Image Placeholder** - Hidden by default (ready for future image support)
3. **Game Header** - Game title with "Game Session" label
4. **Key Information Cards**:
   - Date (formatted with timezone)
   - Time Slots (comma-separated list)
   - Players count with color coding (green if spots available, orange if full)
5. **Description Section** - Full game description with preserved line breaks
6. **Game Master Section** - Shows the host/creator of the game session
7. **Signed Up Players** - List of confirmed players with:
   - Numbered badges (1, 2, 3, etc.)
   - Player names
   - Available slots indicator
8. **Waitlist Section** - Appears if game is full or has waitlist:
   - Shows waitlisted players with yellow badges
   - Count of waitlisted players
   - Empty state message
9. **Metadata Section** - Technical information:
   - Created timestamp
   - Last updated timestamp
   - Session ID

### 4. Updated Find Games Page
**File**: `app/find/page.tsx`

- Added `Link` import from Next.js
- Wrapped game session titles in clickable links
- Links navigate to `/games/[id]` for each session
- Added hover effect for better UX

## Features Implemented

✅ **All game details displayed** - Title, date, time, description, max players
✅ **List of signed up players** - Shows all players with their names
✅ **Waitlist support** - Shows waitlist when applicable
✅ **Image placeholder** - Hidden when no image (ready for future enhancement)
✅ **Responsive design** - Uses Tailwind CSS for mobile-friendly layout
✅ **Color coding** - Green for available slots, orange for full, yellow for waitlist
✅ **Metadata display** - Shows creation/update timestamps and session ID
✅ **Navigation** - Back link and clickable titles from find page

## Design Decisions

1. **Server-Side Rendering**: The page uses Next.js App Router with async server components for optimal performance and SEO
2. **Batch User Fetching**: `getUsersBasicInfo()` fetches all user data in a single MongoDB query for efficiency
3. **Image Placeholder Logic**: Uses a boolean condition to easily enable/disable the image section in the future
4. **Color Semantics**: 
   - Sky blue for interactive elements
   - Green for available spots
   - Orange for full sessions
   - Yellow for waitlist
5. **Consistent Styling**: Matches the existing design system with slate colors and rounded borders

## Future Enhancements

The implementation is ready for:
- [ ] Adding game session images (image upload and storage)
- [ ] Join/leave buttons on the detail page
- [ ] Edit functionality for game creators
- [ ] Share/copy link functionality
- [ ] Player profile links
- [ ] Comments or chat for the session

## Testing

To test the implementation:
1. Ensure MongoDB is configured with `MONGODB_URI` environment variable
2. Create a game session via `/post` page
3. Navigate to `/find` page
4. Click on a game title to view the detail page
5. Verify all information displays correctly
6. Check that player lists show proper names
7. Verify waitlist appears when session is full
