# Distance Display Fix

## Issue
Distance was disappearing from game cards after a user joined a game session.

## Root Cause
When a user joins a game session via the `/api/games/[id]/join` endpoint:
1. The API returns the updated session with new player information and host details
2. The frontend replaces the entire session object in state with this updated session
3. The updated session from the API does NOT include the `distance` field (only calculated during location-based searches)
4. Result: Distance disappears from the card after joining

## Solution
Modified `app/find/page.tsx` in the `handleCharacterSelect` function to preserve the `distance` field from the original session when updating with the joined session data:

```typescript
// Before:
setGameSessions(prevSessions =>
  prevSessions.map(session =>
    session.id === sessionToJoin ? updatedSession : session
  )
);

// After:
setGameSessions(prevSessions =>
  prevSessions.map(session =>
    session.id === sessionToJoin 
      ? { ...updatedSession, distance: session.distance } 
      : session
  )
);
```

## Edge Cases Handled
1. **No distance originally**: If `session.distance` is `undefined`, spreading it preserves the undefined value
2. **Distance exists**: The original distance value is preserved from the search
3. **Other fields**: All updated fields from the API (player lists, etc.) are properly updated
4. **TypeScript safety**: The distance field is already typed as optional in the GameSession type

## Testing
- ✅ Build successful
- ✅ Lint passed (no new warnings)
- ✅ TypeScript compilation successful
- ✅ Edge cases considered

## Files Modified
- `app/find/page.tsx` - Added distance preservation in join handler (1 line changed)

## Impact
Users who search for games by location will now continue to see the distance after joining a game, maintaining consistency in the UI.
