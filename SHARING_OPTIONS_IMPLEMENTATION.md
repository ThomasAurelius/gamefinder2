# Sharing Options Implementation

## Overview
This document describes the implementation of comprehensive sharing options for games, campaigns, characters, and marketplace items in The Gathering Call platform.

## Feature Summary

Added four sharing options across all major content types:
- **Facebook** - Opens Facebook share dialog in a popup window
- **Discord** - Copies formatted message to clipboard for pasting in Discord channels
- **Email** - Opens default email client with pre-filled subject and body
- **Copy Link** - Copies the URL to clipboard with visual feedback

## Implementation Details

### New Component: ShareButtons
**File:** `components/ShareButtons.tsx`

A reusable React component that provides all four sharing options with:
- Responsive design (hides text labels on mobile screens)
- Inline feedback notifications instead of browser alerts
- Proper error handling
- Visual feedback for successful copy operations
- SPA-safe navigation (uses `window.open` for email)

**Props:**
- `url` (string) - The URL to share
- `title` (string) - The title for the shared content
- `description` (string, optional) - Additional description text

### Updated Pages

#### 1. Game Detail Page
**File:** `app/games/[id]/page.tsx`
- Replaced single Facebook share button with comprehensive ShareButtons
- Shares game name, date, and session URL

#### 2. Campaign Detail Page
**File:** `components/CampaignDetail.tsx`
- Added ShareButtons for both hosts and participants
- Shares campaign name, date, and campaign URL

#### 3. Character Detail Page
**File:** `app/players/[id]/characters/[characterId]/page.tsx`
- Added ShareButtons for public character profiles
- Shares character name, class, level, and profile URL

#### 4. Marketplace Item Detail Page
**File:** `app/marketplace/[id]/page.tsx`
- Added ShareButtons for marketplace listings
- Shares listing title, description preview, and listing URL

#### 5. Post Game Page
**File:** `app/post/page.tsx`
- Replaced Facebook share with ShareButtons after successful game post
- Shares newly created game session

#### 6. Post Campaign Page
**File:** `app/post-campaign/page.tsx`
- Replaced Facebook share with ShareButtons after successful campaign post
- Shares newly created campaign

## User Experience

### Facebook Sharing
- Opens in a centered popup window (600x400px)
- Pre-fills the URL and optional quote
- User can add their own comments before posting

### Discord Sharing
- Copies a formatted message with:
  - **Bold title**
  - Description text
  - URL
- Shows inline notification confirming copy
- User can paste directly into Discord channels

### Email Sharing
- Opens default email client
- Pre-fills subject with content title
- Pre-fills body with description and URL
- User can modify before sending

### Copy Link
- Copies URL to clipboard
- Shows visual feedback with checkmark icon
- Changes button color to green temporarily
- Auto-resets after 2 seconds

## Technical Notes

### Browser Compatibility
- Uses modern Clipboard API (`navigator.clipboard.writeText`)
- Falls back to inline error messages if clipboard access fails
- Compatible with all modern browsers

### Security
- No security vulnerabilities detected (verified with CodeQL)
- No XSS risks - all user content is properly encoded
- No CSRF issues - read-only sharing operations

### Performance
- Component is client-side only ("use client" directive)
- Minimal re-renders with useState hooks
- No external API calls (except opening share dialogs)

## Migration from ShareToFacebook

The old `ShareToFacebook` component has been fully replaced with `ShareButtons`:
- All 6 usage locations updated
- Old component kept for backward compatibility
- No breaking changes to existing functionality

4. **Copy Link:**
