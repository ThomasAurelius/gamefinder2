# Host Dashboard Sessions Feature - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Added "Upcoming Sessions" and "Recent Sessions" sections to the Host Dashboard (`/host/dashboard`) that display game sessions from the next 7 days and past 7 days respectively. Each session shows all players with individual refund buttons for the host.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. New API Endpoint: `/api/host/sessions`
**File:** `app/api/host/sessions/route.ts`

**Purpose:** Fetches and filters campaigns for the authenticated host user based on date ranges.

**Query Parameters:**
- `type=upcoming` - Returns sessions from today to +7 days
- `type=recent` - Returns sessions from -7 days to today (excluding today)

**Features:**
- Authenticates the user via cookies
- Filters campaigns where the user is the host (not just participating)
- Sorts upcoming sessions in ascending order, recent sessions in descending order
- Batch-fetches player information (name, avatar) for efficiency
- Returns enriched session data with player details

### 2. New Component: SessionCard
**File:** `components/SessionCard.tsx`

**Purpose:** Reusable component to display individual session details with refund functionality.

**Features:**
- Displays game name, date, times, player count, and cost per session
- Lists all players categorized by status:
  - ‚úÖ Signed Up (green badge)
  - ‚è≥ Waitlisted (yellow badge)
  - üïê Pending (gray badge)
- Individual "Refund" button for each player
- Confirmation dialog before processing refund
- Success/error message display
- Player avatars with proper accessibility (alt text)
- Links to player profiles
- Handles refund via existing `/api/stripe/refund` API
- Callback to parent component for data refresh after refund

### 3. Updated Host Dashboard
**File:** `app/host/dashboard/page.tsx`

**New Sections:**
1. **Upcoming Sessions**
   - Shows sessions scheduled for the next 7 days
   - Empty state: "No upcoming sessions in the next 7 days"
   
2. **Recent Sessions**
   - Shows sessions from the past 7 days
   - Empty state: "No sessions in the past 7 days"

**Features:**
- Fetches session data on component mount
- Loading states during data fetch
- Refetches data after successful refund
- Uses SessionCard component for consistent display
- Maintains existing dashboard functionality (Stripe Connect status, Payment Terms, Quick Actions)

## User Flow

### Viewing Sessions
1. Host navigates to `/host/dashboard`
2. Dashboard loads and displays:
   - Stripe Connect onboarding status
   - Payment terms
   - Quick actions
   - **NEW:** Upcoming Sessions (next 7 days)
   - **NEW:** Recent Sessions (past 7 days)
3. Each session shows game details and all players

### Issuing Refunds
1. Host clicks "Refund" button next to a player's name
2. Confirmation dialog appears: "Are you sure you want to issue a refund to [Player Name]? This action cannot be undone."
3. If confirmed:
   - API call to `/api/stripe/refund` with campaign ID and player ID
   - Success message: "Refund issued successfully to [Player Name]"
   - Session list automatically refreshes
4. If error:
   - Error message displayed with specific error details

## Technical Architecture

### Data Flow
```
Host Dashboard
    ‚Üì
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚Üí /api/host/sessions?type=upcoming
    ‚îÇ       ‚Üì
    ‚îÇ   listCampaigns (filters by host)
    ‚îÇ       ‚Üì
    ‚îÇ   getUsersBasicInfo (batch fetch)
    ‚îÇ       ‚Üì
    ‚îÇ   Returns enriched session data
    ‚îÇ
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚Üí /api/host/sessions?type=recent
            (same flow as above)

SessionCard Component
    ‚Üì (on refund button click)
    /api/stripe/refund
        ‚Üì
    Stripe API
        ‚Üì
    Success/Error
        ‚Üì
    Refresh session data
```

### Key Design Decisions

1. **7-Day Window:** Sessions are filtered to show only the next/past 7 days for focus on immediate/recent activities
2. **Individual Refund Buttons:** Each player has their own refund button rather than bulk operations, allowing precise control
3. **Batch Fetching:** Player information is fetched in a single batch request to minimize API calls
4. **Existing API Reuse:** Leverages the existing `/api/stripe/refund` endpoint for consistency
5. **Confirmation Dialog:** Uses browser-native `confirm()` for simplicity (could be enhanced with a custom modal in the future)
6. **Automatic Refresh:** Session list automatically refreshes after refund to show updated data

## Code Quality

### TypeScript Types
All components and functions use proper TypeScript typing:
- `ConnectStatus` - Stripe Connect account status
- `Player` - Player information with ID, name, and optional avatar
- `Session` - Session with enriched player details
- `SessionsResponse` - API response structure

### Accessibility
- Proper alt text for images: `"${player.name}'s avatar"`
- Semantic HTML structure
- Clear button labels
- Confirmation dialogs for destructive actions

### Error Handling
- Try-catch blocks for all async operations
- User-friendly error messages
- Console logging for debugging
- Graceful fallbacks (e.g., "Unknown Player" if fetch fails)

### Code Organization
- Extracted `fetchSessions` function to avoid duplication
- Reusable `SessionCard` component
- Separation of concerns (API, UI, state management)

## Testing Checklist

### Functional Testing
- [ ] Upcoming sessions display correctly for campaigns in next 7 days
- [ ] Recent sessions display correctly for campaigns in past 7 days
- [ ] Player lists show all signed up, waitlisted, and pending players
- [ ] Refund button works for each player type
- [ ] Confirmation dialog appears before refund
- [ ] Success message shows after successful refund
- [ ] Error message shows on refund failure
- [ ] Session list refreshes after refund
- [ ] Empty states display when no sessions exist
- [ ] Loading states display during data fetch

### Edge Cases
- [ ] Host with no upcoming sessions
- [ ] Host with no recent sessions
- [ ] Session with no players
- [ ] Session with only waitlisted players
- [ ] Session with only pending players
- [ ] Multiple refunds in succession
- [ ] Refund while sessions are loading

### Integration Testing
- [ ] API endpoint returns correct data structure
- [ ] Stripe refund API is called with correct parameters
- [ ] Player information batch fetch works efficiently
- [ ] Date filtering logic works correctly (7-day windows)
- [ ] Authentication works properly

## Future Enhancements

### Possible Improvements
1. **Custom Modal:** Replace browser `confirm()` with styled modal dialog
2. **Bulk Refunds:** Add ability to refund all players in a session at once
3. **Refund Reasons:** Add dropdown for common refund reasons
4. **Refund History:** Show history of refunds issued
5. **Session Notes:** Add ability to add notes to sessions
6. **Export Data:** Export session/refund data to CSV
7. **Notifications:** Email notifications when refunds are issued
8. **Date Range Filter:** Allow custom date ranges instead of fixed 7-day windows
9. **Session Status:** Show whether session occurred, was cancelled, etc.
10. **Player Communication:** Quick message button to contact players

## Files Modified/Created

### Created
- `app/api/host/sessions/route.ts` (115 lines)
- `components/SessionCard.tsx` (233 lines)

### Modified
- `app/host/dashboard/page.tsx` (added ~120 lines)

### Total Changes
- 3 files changed
- ~468 lines added
- Minimal changes to existing code

## Dependencies
No new dependencies added. Uses existing:
- Next.js App Router
- React hooks (useState, useEffect)
- Existing API endpoints
- Existing Stripe integration
- Existing database queries

## Performance Considerations
- Batch fetching of player information reduces API calls
- Date filtering happens at database level
- Sessions loaded once on mount
- Refresh only on explicit action (refund)
- No real-time updates (could be added with WebSockets/polling if needed)

## Security Considerations
- Authentication required for API endpoint (checks userId cookie)
- Verification that user is the host before returning data
- Existing refund API handles authorization
- No sensitive data exposed in client-side code
- Confirmation dialog prevents accidental refunds
