# Edit Game Modal Time Slots Fix

## Issue
The Edit Game Modal (`components/EditGameModal.tsx`) had a different implementation for time slots compared to the rest of the application. It used period-based time slots (Morning, Afternoon, Evening, Night) instead of hourly time slots.

## Solution
Updated `components/EditGameModal.tsx` to use the same hourly time slot implementation as the rest of the application.

## Changes Made

### 1. Import TIME_SLOTS Constant
- Added import: `import { TIME_SLOTS } from "@/lib/constants"`
- This imports the standard 24-hour time slots used throughout the app

### 2. Removed Hardcoded Time Slots
**Before:**
```typescript
const TIME_SLOTS = [
  "Morning (9am-12pm)",
  "Afternoon (12pm-5pm)",
  "Evening (5pm-9pm)",
  "Night (9pm+)",
];
```

**After:**
Uses the imported `TIME_SLOTS` from `lib/constants.ts` which generates:
```typescript
["12:00 AM", "1:00 AM", "2:00 AM", ..., "11:00 PM"]
```

### 3. Enhanced Time Selection
- Added shift-click range selection support (matching the post page behavior)
- Added state to track the last clicked slot for range selection
- Updated `handleTimeToggle` to support both single-click and shift-click selection

### 4. Updated UI Layout
- Changed from 2-column grid to flexible wrap layout
- Updated button styles to match the rest of the app:
  - Rounded-full instead of rounded-lg
  - Smaller padding (px-3 py-1.5) and text size (text-xs)
  - Consistent color scheme with other time slot selectors
- Added helper text: "Click to select individual times or hold Shift and click to select a range."
- Added count display: "{times.length} time slot(s) selected"

## Consistency
The EditGameModal now uses the exact same time slot implementation as:
- `/app/post/page.tsx` (Post Game page)
- `/app/profile/page.tsx` (Profile page)

This ensures a consistent user experience across the entire application.

## Benefits
1. **Consistency**: All time slot selectors now use the same hourly format
2. **Granularity**: Users can now select specific hours instead of broad time periods
3. **Flexibility**: Shift-click range selection makes it easier to select multiple consecutive hours
4. **Better UX**: The UI matches the rest of the application, reducing confusion

## Testing
- Build completed successfully with no errors
- TypeScript compilation passed
- Implementation matches the pattern used in other components
