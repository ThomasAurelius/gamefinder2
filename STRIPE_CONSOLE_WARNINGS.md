# Stripe Console Warnings Guide

## Expected Console Warnings

When using Stripe payment integration, you may see certain console warnings that are **completely normal and can be safely ignored**. This document explains what they are and why they occur.

---

## 1. Stripe Billing Portal CSP Warnings

### What You Might See:
```
Refused to load the font 'data:font/truetype;charset=utf-8;base64,...' because it violates 
the following Content Security Policy directive: "font-src https://a300.stripecdn.com".

Refused to connect to 'https://sourcemaps.corp.stripe.com/...' because it violates 
the following Content Security Policy directive: "connect-src 'self' https://m.stripe.com ..."
```

### Why This Happens:
- These warnings occur when users navigate to **Stripe's Billing Portal** (a Stripe-hosted page)
- The Stripe Billing Portal is accessed at URLs like `billing.stripe.com` or `customer-portal.stripe.com`
- Stripe sets its own Content Security Policy (CSP) on their hosted pages
- Some of Stripe's internal resources (like fonts and sourcemaps) may trigger CSP warnings in certain browsers

### Is This a Problem?
**No!** These warnings are:
- ✅ **Expected behavior** - Stripe's infrastructure intentionally uses strict CSP
- ✅ **Safe to ignore** - They don't affect functionality
- ✅ **External to your app** - They come from Stripe's servers, not your application
- ✅ **Not visible to users** - Only developers with browser console open see these
- ✅ **Not blocking payments** - All payment functionality works normally

### What You Cannot Control:
- Stripe's internal CSP policies on their hosted pages
- Resources Stripe loads on their billing portal
- Warnings that appear when users visit Stripe-hosted pages

### What This App Controls:
Our application sets appropriate CSP headers in `next.config.ts` that:
- ✅ Allow Stripe.js to load and function
- ✅ Allow Stripe Elements (payment forms) to embed properly
- ✅ Allow connections to Stripe's API endpoints
- ✅ Allow fonts from Stripe CDN and data URIs
- ✅ Maintain security while enabling Stripe functionality

## 2. Google Pay Manifest Warnings

### What You Might See:
```
Unable to download payment manifest "https://pay.google.com/about/redirect/"
```

### Why This Happens:
- Stripe's Payment Element checks if Google Pay is available
- The browser attempts to fetch a Google Pay manifest file
- This check happens automatically and may fail in some browsers/contexts

### Is This a Problem?
**No!** This warning is:
- ✅ **Documented by Stripe** - See `PAYMENT_ERRORS_GUIDE.md`
- ✅ **Harmless** - Doesn't affect payment functionality
- ✅ **Expected** - Happens during Google Pay availability checks
- ✅ **Not user-facing** - Only visible in developer console

---

## 3. Sourcemap Warnings

### What You Might See:
```
Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404 (Not Found)
https://sourcemaps.corp.stripe.com/...
```

### Why This Happens:
- Stripe's JavaScript files reference sourcemaps for debugging
- Sourcemaps are Stripe's internal development tools
- They may not be publicly accessible

### Is This a Problem?
**No!** These warnings:
- ✅ **Don't affect functionality** - Sourcemaps are only for debugging
- ✅ **Are Stripe's internal tools** - Not meant for external developers
- ✅ **Can be safely ignored** - Production code works fine without them

## Summary

### When to Worry:
- ❌ Users cannot complete payments
- ❌ Payment forms don't load at all
- ❌ API requests to your server fail
- ❌ Actual JavaScript errors (not just warnings)

### When NOT to Worry:
- ✅ CSP warnings about Stripe's internal resources
- ✅ Google Pay manifest warnings
- ✅ Sourcemap 404 errors
- ✅ Font loading warnings from Stripe's portal

### Testing Your Integration:
To verify everything works correctly:
1. Create a test campaign with a cost per session
2. Navigate to the payment page
3. Complete a test payment with card `4242 4242 4242 4242`
4. Check that payment succeeds despite any console warnings
5. Visit the Stripe Billing Portal from subscriptions page
6. Confirm portal loads and functions correctly

### Need Help?
If you see console errors (not warnings) or payment functionality is broken:
1. Check `PAYMENT_ERRORS_GUIDE.md` for common issues
2. Verify Stripe API keys are correctly configured in `.env.local`
3. Run `npm run validate:stripe` to test your configuration
4. Check Stripe Dashboard for payment status and error logs

## Technical Details

### Our Application's CSP Configuration
The CSP headers set in `next.config.ts` allow:
- **Scripts**: Self, inline, eval, js.stripe.com, m.stripe.com
- **Styles**: Self, inline
- **Images**: Self, data URIs, any HTTPS
- **Fonts**: Self, data URIs, Google Fonts
- **Connections**: Self, all Stripe API domains, Stripe telemetry
- **Frames**: Self, Stripe iframe domains

This configuration ensures Stripe Elements work correctly while maintaining security.

### External CSP Policies
When users navigate to Stripe-hosted pages (billing portal, customer portal), those pages have their own CSP policies that we do not control. Any warnings from those pages are managed by Stripe's infrastructure team and do not indicate problems with our integration.
